                            but what they did was simply wrong,” or “My family can’t
                            survive financially as a result of this incident,” or
                            “I want to make sure this doesn’t happen to someone else”?
                            These are the statements we hear from our clients every day.

                            At Wilt & Klausing, PLLC, our attorneys and staff are guided by
                            the simple principle: Do what is right. If our investigation reveals
                            that you or your loved one has been injured due to the negligence of another,
                            we are dedicated to obtaining justice for you and your family.
                        </p>

                            when dealing with the court and opposing parties.
                            We know that often when a family asks for our help,
                            they are going through one of the most difficult times in their life.
                            Our office will treat you with compassion and honesty to help shepherd you
                            through the legal process.

                    <h3>WHEN</h3>
                    <span>Is the Right Time to Take Legal Action?</span>
                    <p>
                        At a time when you are likely struggling to cope with the emotional trauma of your accident and
                        the physical devastation of your injuries, turning to the law may be the furthest thing from
                        your mind. At a certain point, however, the loss becomes too much to bear and legal action
                        becomes necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If this sounds like your situation, you could be entitled to a sizable injury settlement,
                        depending on the individual circumstances of your case. Some of the most common types of
                        accidents and incidents our firm takes on include:
                    </p>
                    <div class="action">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Nursing home abuse</li>
                            <li>Birth injuries</li>
                            <li>Medical malpractice</li>

                            <li>Motor vehicle accidents</li>
                            <li>Dog bites</li>
                            <li>Premises liability</li>

                    <p>
                        The first step in making the decision to file a claim is to reach out to an attorney. While you
                        focus on recuperating, we’ll be able to work on establishing who is at fault for the injuries
                        you
                        suffered, gather evidence to support your case, and calculate what your lawsuit it worth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As can be seen, there are many different types of incidents that warrant the pursuit of a
                        personal
                        injury claim in Kentucky. If you don’t see your accident listed above, that doesn’t necessarily
                        mean
                        we can’t take on your case. The true determination of whether a personal injury claim is
                        warranted
                        is if someone else is responsible, directly or indirectly, for causing the injuries you endured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, it isn’t always easy to figure out who is to blame, as is often the case in
                        medical
                        malpractice lawsuits and nursing home abuse cases, for example. In these situations, it may be
                        in
                        your best interests to discuss the details of your injury. Your lawyer can then dig a little
                        deeper
                        into your case and determine two things: one, if a claim is worth seeking, and two, who is going
                        to
                        be found liable.

                    <p>When you think of the personal injury claims process as a whole, you can break it up into two
                        parts: establishing fault and obtaining maximum compensation for your losses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These losses are more commonly referred to as “damages” in the legal field and are further
                        categorized as being economic or non-economic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Economic damages are the ones most frequently thought of when injury victims consider filing a
                        civil claim, as these losses consist of your financial damages. Such economic damages often
                        include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Property damage</li>
                        <li>Medical bills and equipment</li>
                        <li>Loss of income</li>
                        <li>Diminished earning capacity</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="right-content">
                    <p>
                        Many accident survivors are unaware of the fact that they can seek compensation for every way
                        their life has been impacted by the injuries they endured. This brings us to non-economic
                        damages, which include any loss that does not have a monetary value. Some examples include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Loss of companionship and love</li>
                        <li>Physical pain and suffering</li>
                        <li>Diminished quality of life</li>
                        <li>Disfigurement</li>
                        <li>Emotional turmoil</li>
                        <li>Inconvenience</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These are just a few of the various types of damages that your attorney may take into
                        consideration when computing the value of your personal injury lawsuit. You can speak with your
                        lawyer in detail about other losses you may have been coping with.

                        severely injured, they have to build a strong legal case that shows that they deserve

                        <span>What is the statute of limitations for personal injury claims in Kentucky?</span>
                        <p>The Kentucky statute of limitations is relatively short in comparison to the rest of the
                            U.S., giving injury victims just one year from the date they were injured to file their
                            civil claim. If you fail to file before time runs out, you’ll lose the chance to obtain
                            compensation for all you’ve been through.

                        <span>How will comparative negligence affect my injury settlement?</span>
                        <p>The Kentucky comparative negligence statute allows those who have suffered serious injuries
                            to file a lawsuit even in cases where they are partially to blame for the cause of the
                            accident.

                            However, you still need to take accountability for your own actions, and the court ensures
                            that you do so by reducing any amount you are awarded by your portion of fault. For
                            instance, if you are found 25 percent at fault and were awarded $500,000, your award would
                            be reduced by 25 percent and your settlement would amount to $375,000.

                        <p>Having to bring your case before a judge is always a possibility, but if your lawyer can get
                            the insurance company to settle your claim fairly, it may be avoided. With that being said,
                            it is important to keep in mind that even if the insurer settles at the maximum amount, this
                            may still not be enough to meet your needs, which would mean you would have to go to
                            Kentucky court to get the most out of your claim.

                        <p>Yes, you can sue on behalf of a child. Children have the same right to compensation after an
                            accident that adults do; they simply can’t legally file the claim themselves. Particularly
                            with children who are unable to understand the process, as is the case with infants who are
                            injured during birth, you, as their parent or legal guardian, have to be their advocate.

                        <span>Is it true that you shouldn’t give a statement to the insurance company?</span>
                        <p>No matter what type of accident you’ve been involved in, there is a strong possibility that
                            one way or another, you’ll be dealing with an insurance company. With that being said, it is
                            not uncommon for insurers to use unscrupulous tactics for their own financial gain.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To ensure that you aren’t taken advantage of in your time of need, we do not usually
                            recommend providing the insurance company with a statement. Instead, direct them to your
                            attorney, who can help protect your injury settlement from being unfairly reduced.

                        <span>What is the statute of limitations for personal injury claims in Kentucky?</span>
                        <p>The Kentucky statute of limitations is relatively short in comparison to the rest of the
                            U.S., giving injury victims just one year from the date they were injured to file their
                            civil claim. If you fail to file before time runs out, you’ll lose the chance to obtain
                            compensation for all you’ve been through.
